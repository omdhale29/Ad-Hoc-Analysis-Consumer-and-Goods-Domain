BUSINESS MODEL OF ATLIQ

AtliQ is a computer hardware manufacturing company that produces a wide range of hardware products and distributes them through multiple sales and distribution channels. The company operates a manufacturing facility where the hardware is produced and then moved to warehouses and distribution centers. From these centers, the products are dispatched to various destinations, depending on the type of customer or channel.
 
AtliQ has a multi-channel customers. The first major channel is the Retail Channel, which includes both platforms which is brick-and-mortar stores which is physical stores like Croma, Staples, and BestBuy, and e-commerce stores which is online stores such as Amazon and Flipkart. These retailers purchase hardware in bulk from AtliQ and then sell the products to end consumers through their physical or online storefronts.

The second channel is the Direct Channel, which includes AtliQ’s own sales platforms—AtliQ E-store and AtliQ Exclusive outlets. Through this channel, AtliQ sells directly to end consumers without any intermediaries, allowing the company to control the customer experience and retain full profit margins.

The third channel is the Distributor Channel, which comes into play due to specific country-level regulations. In certain countries, products can only be sold to end consumers through licensed distributors. AtliQ partners with such large national or regional distributors who then supply the products to local stores or sell them directly to consumers.
 
Through these three distinct channels—Retail, Direct, and Distributor—AtliQ ensures that its hardware products reach a broad market across multiple countries. The company generates revenue through both B2B and B2C models: wholesale bulk sales to retailers and distributors, and direct sales to consumers via its own platforms. This diversified approach helps AtliQ maintain flexibility, increase market reach, and build resilience against market or policy changes in any single channel.
